                    <p>
                      I remember when we got our first computer. It was a used
                      computer by the time we got it for Christmas. It was DOS
                      based and used the 5 1/4" floppy disks. Mostly we used it
                      for playing games.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      A few years later, my parents purchased a computer running
                      Win 95. There are photos of me on that computer. My sister
                      once said, "Oh look, you were a nerd, even back then!" I
                      wasn't offended.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>
                      When I was in High School, I was taking computer classes
                      at the local Technical School. As a senior, the school
                      teacher over the Sterling Scholar assigned me the History
                      Sterling Scholar representative. The girl they assigned
                      over the Information Systems had no idea about computers.
                      I went to her and asked her to switch. She readily agreed
                      and I was the Information Systems Sterling Scholar for my
                      High School. At the competition, I actually placed as a
                      runner-up!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In college, I earned an associates degree in Network
                      Management at LDS Business College. I worked with the
                      student Organization SIFE and competed at Nationals. For
                      our project, we refurbished donated computers and gave
                      them to low-income children and schools.

                    <h2>Career</h2>
                    <p>
                      I began working at a residential treatment center as their
                      Network administrator. I designed and built a campus with
                      network infrastructure and over 50 laptops and desktops. I
                      did everything from running fiber between buildings to
                      fixing users password and printing problems. I connected
                      seven buildings and one main building that had classrooms
                      and a computer lab.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      After the treatment center, I worked as the IT Director
                      for Duchesne County. I was responsible for maintaining a
                      network of over 200 devices and a huge geographic area.
                      The county jail was a major responsibility as they
                      required 24/7 connectivity. During this time, I completely
                      overhauled the outdated website and upgraded the email
                      system to gmail.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Currently, I am the State of Utah, where I have been since
                      2011. I service all State agencies from Tabiona to
                      Whiterocks Utah. These agencies include DWS, DCFS, DHS,
                      AP&P, Corrections, UHP, DLD, DMV, DNR, and Agriculture. My
                      responsibilities include everything from deploying and
                      surplussing equipment to unlocking accounts. I am also
                      always trying to find the best solution for the employees
                      to make their job easier and more efficient. I always work
                      to know my fellow employees and provide service that they
                      can trust.
